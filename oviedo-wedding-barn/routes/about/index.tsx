                Natalie was the family member with a vision and a dream. Having
                planned her wedding in the local area and finding there was no
                event space for her, she had a vision of bringing that social
                ground to the town she grew up in. With an engineering degree
                from Florida State University, she has an eye for detail and
                knows how to get things running. As the Venue Manager,
                Natalie leads the team and is passionate about your event. In
                her free time she can be found with her husband, Benjamin, and
                her two children, Henry and Theodore.

                When you visit The Wedding Barn, there is a good chance the
                first face you will see is Davidâ€™s! An alumni from Northeastern
                University, David cultivated a career in management of sales.
                When given the opportunity to work with his family, he jumped to
                join the team as the Sales Manager. As a liason between you and
                the venue, you can always expect a smile when talking to David.
                In his free time he can be found playing board games,
                volunteering at a local summer camp, and hanging out with his
                beagle, Banjo. If you see him walking his dog, feel free to stop
                him and say hello!
