              When you visit The Wedding Barn, there is a good chance the first
              face you will see is Davidâ€™s! An alumni from Northeastern
              University, David cultivated a career in management of sales. When
              given the opportunity to work with his family, he jumped to join
              the team as the Sales Manager. As a liason between you and the
              venue, you can always expect a smile when talking to David. In his
              free time he can be found playing board games, volunteering at a
              local summer camp, and hanging out with his beagle, Banjo. If you
              see him walking his dog, feel free to stop him and say hello!
